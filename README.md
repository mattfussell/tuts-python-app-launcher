# Python GUI App

Sometimes you need to make things to build motivation.

I don't always get python practice in my daily workflow, so I use tutorials to help me find stuff I don't understand. This code is the result of [Build A Python GUI App Tutorial](https://youtu.be/jE-SpRI3K5g) in which you make a python app that uses Tkinter to create a list of applications to launch all at once.
